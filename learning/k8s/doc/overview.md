# Overview

## Concept

Kubernetes is a portable, extensible, open-source platform for managing containerized workloads and services, that facilitates both declarative configuration and automation. It has a large, rapidly growing ecosystem. Kubernetes services, support, and tools are widely available.

### Container benefits

- **Agile application creation and deployment**: increased ease and efficiency of container image creation compared to VM image use.
- **Continuous development, integration, and deployment**: provides for reliable and frequent container image build and deployment with quick and efficient rollbacks (due to image immutability).
- **Dev and Ops separation of concerns**: create application container images at build/release time rather than deployment time, thereby decoupling applications from infrastructure.
- **Observability** not only surfaces OS-level information and metrics, but also application health and other signals.
- **Environmental consistency across development, testing, and production**: Runs the same on a laptop as it does in the cloud.
- **Cloud and OS distribution portability**: Runs on Ubuntu, RHEL, CoreOS, on-premises, on major public clouds, and anywhere else.
- **Application-centric management**: Raises the level of abstraction from running an OS on virtual hardware to running an application on an OS using logical resources.
- **Loosely coupled, distributed, elastic, liberated micro-services**: applications are broken into smaller, independent pieces and can be deployed and managed dynamically â€“ not a monolithic stack running on one big single-purpose machine.
- **Resource isolation**: predictable application performance.
- **Resource utilization**: high efficiency and density.

### K8S Provides

- **Service discovery and load balancing** Kubernetes can expose a container using the DNS name or using their own IP address. If traffic to a container is high, Kubernetes is able to load balance and distribute the network traffic so that the deployment is stable.
- **Storage orchestration** Kubernetes allows you to automatically mount a storage system of your choice, such as local storages, public cloud providers, and more.
- **Automated rollouts and rollbacks** You can describe the desired state for your deployed containers using Kubernetes, and it can change the actual state to the desired state at a controlled rate. For example, you can automate Kubernetes to create new containers for your deployment, remove existing containers and adopt all their resources to the new container.
- **Automatic bin packing** You provide Kubernetes with a cluster of nodes that it can use to run containerized tasks. You tell Kubernetes how much CPU and memory (RAM) each container needs. Kubernetes can fit containers onto your nodes to make the best use of your resources.
- **Self-healing** Kubernetes restarts containers that fail, replaces containers, kills containers that don't respond to your user-defined health check, and doesn't advertise them to clients until they are ready to serve.
- **Secret and configuration management** Kubernetes lets you store and manage sensitive information, such as passwords, OAuth tokens, and SSH keys. You can deploy and update secrets and application configuration without rebuilding your container images, and without exposing secrets in your stack configuration.

### K8S Doesn't

- Does not limit the types of applications supported. Kubernetes aims to support an extremely diverse variety of workloads, including stateless, stateful, and data-processing workloads. If an application can run in a container, it should run great on Kubernetes.
- Does not deploy source code and does not build your application. Continuous Integration, Delivery, and Deployment (CI/CD) workflows are determined by organization cultures and preferences as well as technical requirements.
- Does not provide application-level services, such as middleware (for example, message buses), data-processing frameworks (for example, Spark), databases (for example, MySQL), caches, nor cluster storage systems (for example, Ceph) as built-in services. Such components can run on Kubernetes, and/or can be accessed by applications running on Kubernetes through portable mechanisms, such as the Open Service Broker.
- Does not dictate logging, monitoring, or alerting solutions. It provides some integrations as proof of concept, and mechanisms to collect and export metrics.
- Does not provide nor mandate a configuration language/system (for example, Jsonnet). It provides a declarative API that may be targeted by arbitrary forms of declarative specifications.
  Does not provide nor adopt any comprehensive machine configuration, maintenance, management, or self-healing systems.
- Additionally, Kubernetes is not a mere orchestration system. In fact, it eliminates the need for orchestration. The technical definition of orchestration is execution of a defined workflow: first do A, then B, then C. In contrast, Kubernetes comprises a set of independent, composable control processes that continuously drive the current state towards the provided desired state. It shouldn't matter how you get from A to C. Centralized control is also not required. This results in a system that is easier to use and more powerful, robust, resilient, and extensible.

## K8S Components

### Control plane Components

The control plane's components make global decisions about the cluster (for example, scheduling), as well as detecting and responding to cluster events (for example, starting up a new pod when a deployment's replicas field is unsatisfied).

**kube-apiserver**:

The API server is a component of the Kubernetes control plane that exposes the Kubernetes API. The API server is the front end for the Kubernetes control plane.

**etcd**:

Consistent and highly-available key value store used as Kubernetes' backing store for all cluster data.

**kube-scheduler**:

Control plane component that watches for newly created Pods with no assigned node, and selects a node for them to run on.

Factors taken into account for scheduling decisions include: individual and collective resource requirements, hardware/software/policy constraints, affinity and anti-affinity specifications, data locality, inter-workload interference, and deadlines.

**kube-controller-manager**:

A control loop that watches the shared state of the cluster through the apiserver and makes changes attempting to move the current state towards the desired state.

- Node controller: Responsible for noticing and responding when nodes go down.
- Job controller: Watches for Job objects that represent one-off tasks, then creates Pods to run those tasks to completion.
- Endpoints controller: Populates the Endpoints object (that is, joins Services & Pods).
- Service Account & Token controllers: Create default accounts and API access tokens for new namespaces.

**cloud-controller-manager**:

A Kubernetes control plane component that embeds cloud-specific control logic. The cloud controller manager lets you link your cluster into your cloud provider's API, and separates out the components that interact with that cloud platform from components that only interact with your cluster.

The cloud-controller-manager only runs controllers that are specific to your cloud provider. If you are running Kubernetes on your own premises, or in a learning environment inside your own PC, the cluster does not have a cloud controller manager.

### Node Components

Node components run on every node, maintaining running pods and providing the Kubernetes runtime environment.

**kubelet**:

An agent that runs on each node in the cluster. It makes sure that containers are running in a Pod.

The kubelet takes a set of PodSpecs that are provided through various mechanisms and ensures that the containers described in those PodSpecs are running and healthy. The kubelet doesn't manage containers which were not created by Kubernetes.

**kube-proxy**:

kube-proxy is a network proxy that runs on each node in your cluster, implementing part of the Kubernetes Service concept.

kube-proxy maintains network rules on nodes. These network rules allow network communication to your Pods from network sessions inside or outside of your cluster.

kube-proxy uses the operating system packet filtering layer if there is one and it's available. Otherwise, kube-proxy forwards the traffic itself.

**container-runtime**:

The container runtime is the software that is responsible for running containers. K8S supports Docker, containerd, CRI-O.

### Addons

Addons use Kubernetes resources (DaemonSet, Deployment, etc) to implement cluster features. Because these are providing cluster-level features, namespaced resources for addons belong within the kube-system namespace.

**DNS**:

**Web UI(Dashboard)**:
It allows users to manage and troubleshoot applications running in the cluster, as well as the cluster itself.
**Container Resource Monitoring**:
records generic time-series metrics about containers in a central database, and provides a UI for browsing that data.
**Cluster-level Logging**:
is responsible for saving container logs to a central log store with search/browsing interface.

## Kubernetes API

The core of Kubernetes' control plane is the API server. The API server exposes an HTTP API that lets end users, different parts of your cluster, and external components communicate with one another.

The Kubernetes API lets you query and manipulate the state of API objects in Kubernetes (for example: Pods, Namespaces, ConfigMaps, and Events).

Most operations can be performed through the kubectl command-line interface or other command-line tools, such as kubeadm, which in turn use the API. However, you can also access the API directly using REST calls.

## Kubernetes Objects

**spec**:
a description of the characteristics you want the resource to have: its desired state.
**status**:
describes the current state of the object, supplied and updated by the Kubernetes system and its components.

- `apiVersion` Which version of the Kubernetes API you're using to create this object
- `kind` What kind of object you want to create
- `metadata` Data that helps uniquely identify the object, including a `name` string, `UID`, and optional `namespace`
- `spec` What state you desire for the object

### namespaces

- `default` The default namespace for objects with no other namespace
- `kube-system` The namespace for objects created by the Kubernetes system
- `kube-public` This namespace is created automatically and is readable by all users (including those not authenticated). This namespace is mostly reserved for cluster usage, in case that some resources should be visible and readable publicly throughout the whole cluster. The public aspect of this namespace is only a convention, not a requirement.
- `kube-node-lease` This namespace for the lease objects associated with each node which improves the performance of the node heartbeats as the cluster scales.
