## Introduction to the Principles of Creativity

- Necessity is the mother of invention, Opportunity is the father

Creativity is the ability to imagine or invent something new of value.

## Creative Tools

- Analogy
- Boundary shifting
- Brainstorming
- Checklists

### Brainstorming Techniques

- Flipchart
- Post-its
- Brainwriting
- Alphabet
- Grid
- Circle brainstorming

### Brainstroming Principles

- brainstorming should be a group activity undertaken by an interdisciplinary team;
- there should be no more than ten people present;
- no criticism or mockery of any idea, statement or individual is allowed;
- flip charts, post-its, cards, marker pens, pencils and paper should be provided;
- the design brief should be clearly stated;
- a set period of time should be allocated;
- an individual should be identified to introduce the brief.

## Thinking Styles

## Morphological Analysis

## TRIZ - the theory of Inventive Problem Solving

## SCAMPER

## Using the Tools in combination
