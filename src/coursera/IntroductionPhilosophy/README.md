Proposition

2. Belief

**The classical account of knowledge**:

One can know a proposition is true, only if:

1. That proposition is true
2. One believes that proposition
3. One's belief is justified

**No false lemmas' view**:

One can know a proposition is true, only if:

1. That proposition is true
2. One believes that proposition
3. One's belief is justified
4. One's belief is not based on any false assumptions (or lemmas)
