# Concurrent Programming

## Concurrent Programming With Processes

Build a concurrent program with processes, using `fork`, `exec` and `waitpid`.

> Since the connected descriptors in the parent and child each point to the same file table entry, it is crucial for the parent to close its copy of the connected descriptor.

### Pros & Cons of Processes

Processes have a clean model for sharing state information between parents and children: file tables are shared and user address spaces are not.

It's impossible for one process to accidentally overwrite the virtual memory of another proces, which eliminates a lot of confusing failures.

Separate address spaces make it more difficult for processes to share state information.
