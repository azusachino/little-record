## Concurrent Programming With Processes

Build a concurrent program with processes, using `fork`, `exec` and `waitpid`.

> Since the connected descriptors in the parent and child each point to the same file table entry, it is crucial for the parent to close its copy of the connected descriptor.

### Pros & Cons of Processes

Processes have a clean model for sharing state information between parents and children: file tables are shared and user address spaces are not.

It's impossible for one process to accidentally overwrite the virtual memory of another proces, which eliminates a lot of confusing failures.

Separate address spaces make it more difficult for processes to share state information.

## Concurrent Programming with I/O Multiplexing

The basic idea is to use the _select_ function to ask the kernel to suspend the process, returning control to the application only after one or more I/O events have occurred.

- return when any descriptor in the set `{0, 4}` is ready for reading
- return when any descriptor in the set `{1, 2, 7}` is ready for writting
- time out if 152.13 seconds have elapsed waiting for an I/O event to occur

## Concurrent Programming with Threads

A thread is a logical flow that runs in the context of a process.
