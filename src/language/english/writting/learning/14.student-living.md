## Sample

Many university students today have either chosen university accommodation or shared a flat with their friends. I think it is a rite of passage though these young people may not be able to maintain day-to-day contact with their parents.

Living away from parents means that young people have to learn how to live an independent life. They have to develop some life skills, such as doing housekeeping, managing finances and getting along with flatmates. With these skills, they can handle many matters easily once they enter the workforce. For example, they are more likely to keep everything organised if they have the habit of cleaning their bedrooms.

In addition, college students can enjoy more freedom in social life and make new friends. They do not need to go home every day, so they have more time to do a wide range of activities. They can go to the gym with other students, attend lectures, do assignments in the library and even do part-time work together. In addition to improving social skills, they also have more personal resources to draw upon in the future.

The downside of this choice is that the contact with parents will decline and emotional tie will suffer. They hardly have a meal with their parents and cannot keep up to date with the news about their family. They may feel helpless, if they cannot solve some problems in their studies. This may also affect their attitude towards family life.

In conclusion, it is a good decision for university students to leave home, although it may have a damaging effect on their family relationship.
