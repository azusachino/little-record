## 例子

Many people today frequent fast-food restaurants, because of the fast pace of life and irregular working hours. Fast food has posed a threat to traditional cuisine in many cultures, and people put emphasis on the problems that may arise from this change.

The strong appetite for fast food has become a health issue in countries like America, where the number of overweight people has increased dramatically. This kind of food is not only high in fat, sugar, salt and calories but also served in large portions. This is why it is known as junk food and linked to the obesity epidemic. Those who suffer from obesity are more likely to contract heart diseases than normal-weight people. This means that governments have to pour more money in the medical system, which may have an adverse effect on economic development.

Another problem is that it can affect people's ways of life, including dietary habits. Traditional means of food preparation are known for the diversity of ingredients, cooking styles and flavours, and many traditional dishes show the evolution of cuisine in different regions. However, a vast majority of fast food chains provide American or European food, including hamburgers, fried chicken and pizzas. People's diet is increasingly monotonous, while some traditional recipes may vanish.

The reliance on pre-prepared food also has an adverse effect on family relationships, as people do not participate in family meals as frequently as before. As a general rule, family meals provide family members with an opportunity to communicate with each other and improve mutual understanding. People who always eat outside may not be able to keep up to date with family issues and respond to emotional needs of other family members. Families have become more and more dispersed, and many people feel lonely and helpless when they have problems in daily lives.

I thus agree that the popularity of fast food is a menace. It not only poses a threat ot people's health but also to their cuisine culture and social relationships.
