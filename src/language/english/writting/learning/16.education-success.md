## 作文题目

Some people who have been successful in the society don't attribute their success to the theoretical knowledge they learned from their university. Do you agree that theoretical knowledge is not as valuable as expected?

## 写作大纲

### 介绍段

1. 背景句：关于理论知识对职业成功的贡献，人们一直都有不同的看法。
2. 改写题目：这是可以理解的，因为很多在事业上获得成功的人并没有完成大学教育。
3. 阐述立场：我认为大学所学的东西对成功是至关重要的。

### 主体1

1. 中心句（学习能力）：通过学习理论，人们可以知道某个科目的概念和原则，因此可以成为某个行业的专业人士。
2. 举例：譬如，一个心理医生不可能确定有效的治疗方案，除非他了解各种解释人们心理疾病的理论。
3. 解释：很多理论都是基于实践经验发展起来的，因此具有现实的意义，而掌握这些理论的人可以有很好的工作前景，甚至因为革新而获得大量财富。

### 主体2

1. 中心句：学习理论还有一个好处，就是能够提高人们解决问题的能力以及创新能力。
2. 解释1：大学生可以提高研究能力，收集信息去了解不同的课题。
3. 解释2：理论可以开拓人的思维，提高人的思辨能力，让人们可以使用不同理论去推动知识的进步
4. 对比：相比之下，没有上过大学的人可以参加一些实践训练去处理一些普遍问题，但是在面对一些非常规问题的时候就束手无策。

### 主体3

1. 中心句：我们也需要承认一个事实：理论知识不是人们成功的唯一因素
2. 解释：有趣的是，很多成功的人士被发现有相似的性格特点
3. 举例：一个乐观的、勤奋的、积极的、善于与人交往的人更能够克服困难，和别人合作，从而能够获得成功。
4. 附加观点：另外一个因素可能是社会关系网，通过这个网络，人们可以获取信息、想法和资源
5. 解释：譬如，一些商业人士可以告诉他们怎么和政府保持好的关系，而教科书上未必有这样的知识。

### 结论

1. 再次表面立场：大学教育的价值没有被人们正确地认知，而人们可以更加有效地甚至有创意地解决问题。
2. 我们同时需要承认，除了教育以外，人的性格和社会关系也是成功地因素。

## 注意

1. 中文生硬地翻译成英文
2. 使用长单词，不重视词伙

## 例子

People have different views about the contribution of theoretical knowledge to one's achievement. This is understandable due to the fact that a considerable number of people who did not complete a university degree have achieved success in their careers. In my view, what students have learnt at university is vitally important to a fulfilling career.

By learning theories, people can gain a full understanding of concepts and principles of different subjects, so they can build expertise in their professions. For example, a psychiatrist cannot identify effective therapies, unless he or she is well-informed about all the theories about the causes of different mental health issues. Many theories have developed on the basis of empirical knowledge, so these theories have practical implications and people who are familiar with theories can have a good job prospect and even earn a fortune with some innovations they have advanced.

Another advantage of learning theories is that students can improve problem-solving abilities and exercise creative potential. University students can improve research skills and collect information on different subject matters. Theoretical knowledge could broaden people's minds and improve critical thinking skills, empowering them to push forward the boundaries of knowledge. In contrast, some people who did not go to university may receive some practical training to deal with some general problems, but they may be helpless in the face of unusual problems.

Meanwhile, we must recoginse the fact that theoretical knowledge is not the noly determinant of success. Many successful people have some personality traits in common. An optimistic, hardworking and sociable person is able to overcome difficulties and cooperate with others to achieve success. Another factor might be the social network, by which people can receive information, draw upon ideas and gain access to resources. For instance, some businesspeople can tell them how to maintain a good relationship with the government, and this kind of knowledge may not be available in textbooks.

In a word, higher education has been undervalued, and people can handle many problems effectively and creatively with knowledge they have acquired at university. On the other hand, we need to admit that personality and social relationship are also essential to success.
