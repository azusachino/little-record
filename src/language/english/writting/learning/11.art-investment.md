## Sample

People have different views about government funding for the arts, especially in economically tough times. I reckon that we should give priority to essential services and infrastructures and then fund the arts when governments have a budget surplus.

The supporters of the public funds for the arts argue that cities can become more visually attractive because of art. It is true that artworks, including sculptures, paintings and statues can decorate public facilities such as libraries, metro stations, or even toilets, and increase the artistic appeal of these places. If the art industry prospers, cities have a mix of different architectural styles and we are more likely to enjoy urban life. Exposure to artworks can reduce our pressure and put us in a good mood.

Despite this, many people would argue that public facilities deserve more of public money. Ordinary people are more interested in public facilities(such as water and electricity supply networks, schools, libraries and roads), which have a direct impact on their living standards. For example, good sanitation and clean water can improve people's health and reduce diseases, while schools and libraries can dissenminate knowledge and improve young people's job propects. In contrast, sculptures, paintings and operas are luxury items to most people and are not likely to bring tangible benefits to them.

In my view, improvements in public facilities can promote economic development, but the arts may be less important in economic terms. For example, the investment in the trasport system can improve the productivity of working people by making daily commuting easier, while the public sepnding on high-speed railway systems and airports can ensure that cargo can be delivered faster. Cities can attract investment and become wealthy, so people's living standards can also be improved. By contrast, the investment in the arts cannot create such returns in a short time.

To sum up, I believe the government should focus on services and facilities vital to the wellbeing of the general public, even though artistic projects can make our cities spectualar.

## Practice

People hold different views on the investment to arts. While I believe that it is worthwhile to make arts more official.

The funds for the art can make many differences in our daily life. For exapmle, with a highly developed artistic society, people can enjoy a better life which means we don't have to spend most of our time on making a living, we can use our time to explore the arts. It is true that artworks, including buildings, musics and paintings can decorate
public facilities such as schools and libraries, and with these artworks, people can go to museums and theaters to pursue their own artistic life. Also, exposure to artworks can reduce our pressure and put us in a good mood.

Despite this, many people argue that it is unreasonable to spend much cash flow on artworks, rather than public facilities. For example, the investment in the transport system will help improve the productivity of working, while the public spending on high-speed railway systems and airports can ensure that cargo can be delivered faster. With these conditions, cities can attract more investment and become wealthy, which will improve people's living standards. By contrast, the investment in the arts cannot create such returns in a short time.

To sum up, I believe that the prosperity of arts is one aspect of the development of one country, the government should focus on economic fisrt.
