## Practice

It is clear that the price people have to pay for traveling across the border decreases dramatically these days. I believe that this situation will bring more unprecedented positive effects.

With the easyness of traveling abroad, people have more chances to make friends from all over the world. If anyone always make contact with his/her global friends, he or she will learn many special things than others who does not have friends outside their country.

Also

To conclude, I think that this change will not only help the cultural conversation but also make more people have the opportunity to learn more different things.
