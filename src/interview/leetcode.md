Could not approach the problem as per interviewer's requirement

Another problem: Guess the next possible words in a sequence.
["A1", "A3", "A5"] extend this sequence to 6 length.
Ans wil be ["A1", "A3", "A5", "A7", "A9", "A11"]
Input can be anything, you need to figure out a sequence and extend it for the required length.
Another ex: ["AB1", "BC3", "CD5"] extend it to 5 length.
Ans will be ["AB1", "BC3", "CD5", "DE7", "EF9"]
Able to provide an approach and had a discussion for possible cases. Not sure if I was correct or wrong as time was up for the interview and we had to end the discussion.
