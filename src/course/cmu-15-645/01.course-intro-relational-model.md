# Introduction & Relational Model

Organized collection of inter-related data that models some aspect of the real-world.

## Why we need DBMS

How about the `csv` files, what kind of problem they will bring to us?

**Search in a csv file**

```py
# if there are million, even billion lines
for line in file.readlines():
    record = parse(line)
    if record[0] == 'target':
        print(record[1])
```

And `csv` files are not capable of maintain relations, such as artists and their albums.

## DBMS

A database management system is software that allows applications to store and analyze information in a database.

A general-purpose DBMS is designed to allow the definition, creation, querying, update and administration of databases.

### Data models

A data model is a collection of concepts for describing the data in a database.

A schema is a description of a particular collection of data, using a given data model.

- Relational
- K/V
- Graph
- Document
- Column-family
- Array/Matrix
- Hierarchical
- Network
- Multi-Value

### Relational Algebra

- Select -> `select * from R where a_id='a2' and b_id>102;`
- Projection -> `select b_id-100, a_id from R where a_id='a2';`
- Union -> `(select * from R) UNION ALL (select * from S);`
- Intersection -> `(select * from R) INTERSECT (select * from S);`
- Difference -> `(select * from R) EXCEPT (select * from S);`
- Product -> `select * from R, S;`
- Join -> `select * from R NATURAL JOIN S;`
