# Intermediate SQL

## Relational Languages

User only needs to specify the answer that they want, not how to compute it. (Declarative VS. Imperative)

## SQL History

- SQL:2016 -> JSON, Polymorphic tables
- SQL:2011 -> Temporal DBs, Pipelined DML
- SQL:2008 -> Truncation, Fancy Sorting
- SQL:2003 -> XML, Windows, Sequences, Auto-Gen IDs
- SQL:1998 -> Regex, Triggers, OO

## SQL Essentials

### Aggregations & Group by

- AVG
- MIN
- MAX
- SUM
- COUNT

```sql
SELECT AVG(gpa), COUNT(sid) FROM student WHERE login LIKE '%@cs';
```

**Group By**

- Non-aggregated values in `SELECT` output clause must appear in `GROUP BY` caluse.
- Filters results based on aggregation computation (use HAVING)

```sql
SELECT AVG(s.gpa), e.cid, s.name
FROM enrolled AS e, student AS s
WHERE e.sid = s.sid
GROUP BY e.cid, s.name;

SELECT AVG(s.gpa) AS avg_gpa, e.cid
FROM enrolled AS e, student AS s
WHERE e.sid = s.sid
GROUP BY e.cid
HAVING AVG(s.gpa) > 3.9;
```

### String Operations

不同的数据库实现对字符串的支持不一样，区别主要在于单双引号和大小写。另外一些操作可能不同，如字符串拼接：

```sql
-- sql-92
SELECT name FROM student WHERE login = LOWER(name) || '@cs';
-- MSSQL
SELECT name FROM student WHERE login = LOWER(name) + '@cs';
-- MySQL
SELECT name FROM student WHERE login = CONCAT(LOWER(name), '@cs');
```

### Output Control & Redirection

- Order By
- Limit

```sql
SELECT sid FROM enrolled WHERE cid = '15-721' ORDER BY grade DESC LIMIT 10;
```

**Output Redirection**

- Table must not already be defined
- Table will have the same # of columns with the same types as the input

```sql
-- MySQL
CREATE TABLE CourseIds(SELECT DISTINCT cid FROM enrolled);
```

### Nested Queries

- ALL: Must satisfy expression for all rows in the sub-query
- ANY: Must satisfy expression for at least one row in the sub-query
- IN: Equivalent to `=ANY()`
- EXISTS: At least one row is returned

```sql
SELECT NAME FROM student WHERE sid = ANY (
    SELECT sid FROM enrolled WHERE cid = '15-415'
);
```

### Window Functions

Performs a "sliding" calculation across a set of tuples that are related.

```sql
-- ROW_NUMBER() -> # of the current row
-- RANK() -> Order position of the current row
SELECT *, ROW_NUMBER() OVER() AS row_num FROM enrolled;
```

### Common Table Expressions

Provides a way to write auxiliary statements for use in a larger query. (a temp table just for one query)

```sql
WITH cteName(col1, col2) AS (
    SELECT 1,2
)
SELECT col1 + col2 FROM cteName;
```
