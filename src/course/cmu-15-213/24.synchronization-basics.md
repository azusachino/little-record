# Synchronization Bacis

## Threads Memory Model

- Multiple threads run within the context of a single process
- Each thread has its own separate thread context
  - Thread ID, stack, stack pointer, PC, condition codes, GP registers
- All Threads share the remaining process context
  - Code, data, heap, and shared library segments of the process virtual address space
  - Open files and installed handlers

## Semaphore

Non-negative global integer synchronization variable.

- Associate a unique semaphore mutex, initially 1, with each shared variable (or related set of shared variables)
- Surround each access to the shared variable(s) with P(mutex) and V(mutex) operations
