# System Level I/O

1. A linux `file` is a sequence of bytes
2. All I/O devices are represented as files
   - `/dev/sda2`
   - `/dev/tty2`
3. The kernel is represented as a file
   - `/boot/vmlinuz-3.13.0-55-generic`
   - `/proc`

## Unix I/O

For more info, please check TLPI.

### Most used APIs

- open
- close
- read
- write
- lseek

### File Types

- Regular file: Contains arbitrary data
- Directory: Index for a related group of files
- Socket: For communicating with a process on another machine
- Named pipes (FIFOs)
- Symbolic links
- Character and block devices

## File Metadata

`stat` | `fstat`

```c
/* Metadata returned by the stat and fstat functions */
struct stat {
    dev_t         st_dev;      /* Device */
    ino_t         st_ino;      /* inode */
    mode_t        st_mode;     /* Protection and file type */
    nlink_t       st_nlink;    /* Number of hard links */
    uid_t         st_uid;      /* User ID of owner */
    gid_t         st_gid;      /* Group ID of owner */
    dev_t         st_rdev;     /* Device type (if inode device) */
    off_t         st_size;     /* Total size, in bytes */
    unsigned long st_blksize;  /* Blocksize for filesystem I/O */
    unsigned long st_blocks;   /* Number of blocks allocated */
    time_t        st_atime;    /* Time of last access */
    time_t        st_mtime;    /* Time of last modification */
    time_t        st_ctime;    /* Time of last change */
};
```
