# Exceptional Control Flow: Exceptions and Processes

## Control Flow

Processors do only one thing: From startup to shutdown, a CPU simply reads and executes(interprets) a sequence of instructions, one at a time

### To alter the control flow

- Jumps and branches (jmp, CE)
- Call and return (assemble code)

Not able to react to changes in **system state**:

- Data arrives from a disk or a network adapter
- Instruction divides by zero (or other wrong format)
- User hit Crtl+C at the keyboard
- System timer expires

### Exceptional Control Flow

- Exceptions: Change in control flow in response to a system event (Low level, implemented by hardware with OS software)
- Process context switch (High level, implemented by OS software and hardware timer)
- Signals (High level, implemented by OS software)
- Nonlocal jumps (High level, implemented by C runtime library)

## Exceptions

An exception is a transfer of control to the OS kernel in response to some event. (Divide by 0, arithmetic overflow, page fault, I/O request completes, typing Ctrl-C)

### Asynchronous Exceptions (Interrupts)

- Caused by events external to the processor
  - Indicate by setting the processor's `interrupt pin`
  - Handler returns to `next` instruction

Timer interrupt, I/O interrupt from external device

### Synchronous Exceptions

Caused by events that occur as a result of executing an instruction:

- Traps
  - Intentional
  - e.g. system calls, breakpoint traps, special instructions
  - Returns control to `next` instruction
- Faults
  - Unintentional by possible recoverable
  - e.g. page faults(recoverable), protection faults(unrecoverable), floating point exceptions
  - Either re-executes faulting ("current") instruction or aborts
- Abort
  - Unintentional and unrecoverable
  - e.g. illegal instruction, parity error, machine check
  - Aborts current program

### System Calls

Each x86-64 system call has a unique ID number (for identification)

## Processes

A process is an instance of a running program.

- Each process is a logical control flow
- Two processes run concurrently if their flows overlap in time
- Otherwise, they are sequential (Single Core)

### Syscall Error Handling

On error, Linux system-level functions typically return -1 and set global variable `errno` to indicate cause.

```c
if ((pid = fork()) < 0) {
    fprintf(stderr, "fork error: %s\n", strerror(errno));
    exit(0);
}
```
