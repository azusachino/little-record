# Bits Manipulation

## Everything is bits

Each bit is 0 or 1.

### Base 2 Number Representation

- `15213` -> `11101101101101`
- `1.20` -> `1.001100110011[0011]`
- `1.5213 * 10^4` -> `1.1101101101101 * 2^13`

## Encoding Byte Values

- Byte = 8 bits.
  - Binary Range: 00000000 to 11111111
  - Decimal Range: 0 to 255
  - Hexadecimal Range: 00 to FF

| ----------- | -------------- | -------------- | ------ |
| char        | 1              | 1              | 1      |
| short       | 2              | 2              | 2      |

| pointer     | 4              | 8              | 8      |

## Boolean Algebra

Encode True as 1 and False as 0.

- And: A&B=1 when both A=1 and B=1
- Or: A|B=1 when either A=1 or B=1
- Not: ~A=1 when A=0
- Exclusive-Or(Xor): A^B=1 when either A=1 or B=1, but not both

### Bit-Level Operations in C

- Apply to any "integral" data type
  - long, int, short, char, unsigned
- View arguments as bit vectors
- Arguments applied bit-wise

### Logic Operations in C

&&, ||, !

- view 0 as Falsy
- Anything nonzero as Truthy
- Always return 0 or 1
- Early termination

## Shift Operations

### Left Shift `x << y`

- shift bit-vector x left y positions (throw away extra bits on left)
- fill with 0 on right

### Right Shift `x >> y`

- shift bit-vector x right y positions (throw away extra bits on right)
- Logical shift: Fill with 0 on left
- Arithmetic shift: Replicate most significant bit on left

### Undefined behavior

Shift amount < 0 or >= word size

## Encoding Integers

`w-1` as the most significant bit [`w-1` --- `0`]

- $B2U(X) = \sum_{i=0}^{w-1}x_i*2^i$
- $B2T(X) = -x_{w-1} * 2^{w-1} + \sum_{i=0}^{w-2}x_i*2^i$

### Sign Bit

For 2's complement, most significant bit indicates sign

- 0 for non-negative
- 1 for negative

### Numeric Ranges

**Unsigned Values**

- UMin = 0
- UMax = $2^w -1$

**Two's Complement Values**

- TMin = $-2^{w-1}$
- TMax = $2^{w-1}-1$

Values for w = 16:

| .    | Decimal | Hex   | Binary            |
| ---- | ------- | ----- | ----------------- |
| UMax | 65535   | FF FF | 11111111 11111111 |
| TMax | 32767   | 7F FF | 01111111 11111111 |
| TMin | -32768  | 80 00 | 10000000 00000000 |
| -1   | -1      | FF FF | 11111111 11111111 |
| 0    | 0       | 00 00 | 00000000 00000000 |

### Unsigned & Signed Numeric Values

| X    | B2U(X) | B2T(X) |
| ---- | ------ | ------ |
| 0000 | 0      | 0      |
| 0001 | 1      | 1      |
| 0010 | 2      | 2      |
| 0011 | 3      | 3      |

| 0111 | 7      | 7      |
| 1000 | 8      | -8     |
| 1001 | 9      | -7     |
| 1010 | 10     | -6     |
| 1011 | 11     | -5     |
| 1100 | 12     | -4     |
| 1101 | 13     | -3     |
| 1110 | 14     | -2     |
| 1111 | 15     | -1     |

### Casting

- If there is a mix of unsigned & signed in single expr **signed values implicitly cast to unsigned**
- Including comparsion operations `<`, `>`, `==`, `<=`, `>=`

### Mapping Signed <-> Unsigned

![.](resources/sign-unsign-convertion.png)

- Bit pattern is maintained
- But reinterpreted
- Can have unexpected effects: adding or substracting $2^w$
- Express containing signed and unsigned int => `int is cast to unsigned`

### Expanding, Truncating

- Expanding
  - Unsigned: zeros added
  - Signed: sign extension (make copies of sign bit)
  - Both yield expected result
- Truncating
  - Unsigned/signed: bits are truncated
  - Result reinterpreted
  - Unsigned: mod operation
  - Signed: similiar to mod
  - For small numbers yields expected behavior

## Addition, Negation, Multiplication, Shifting

### Unsigned Addition

Ignores carry output

$s = UAdd_w(u, v) = (u + v) mod 2^w$

### Two's Complement Addition

TAdd and UAdd have identical Bit-Level behavior

### Unsigned/Signed Mul

Ignores high order _w_ bits

$UMult_w(u,v) = (u*v)mod2^w$

### Arithmetic: Basic Rules

**Addition**

- Unsigned/signed: Normal addition followed by truncate, same operation on bit level
- Unsigned: addition mod $2^w$ (Mathematical addition + possible substraction of $2^w$)
- Signed: modified addition mod $2^w$ (result in proper range)

**Multiplication**

- Unsigned/signed: Normal Multiplication followed by truncate, same operation on bit level
- Unsigned: multiplication mod $2^w$
- Signed: modified multiplication mod $2^w$ (result in proper range)

Because of unsigned, the code below will create an infinite loop.

```c
unsigned i;
for (i = cnt - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
  a[i] += a[i+1];
}
```
