# ECF: Signals and Nonlocal Jumps

## Shell

A shell is an application program that runs programs on behalf of the user.

- sh
- csh
- bash

```c
int main() {
    char cmdline[MAXLINE];

    while(1) {
        printf(">");
        Fgets(cmdline, MAXLINE, stdin);
        if (feof(stdin))
            exit(0);
    }
    eval(cmdline);
}
```

### Shell Problem

1. Background jobs will become zombies when they terminates
2. Background jobs will never be reaped because shell will not terminate
3. Background jobs will create a memory leak that could run the kernel out of memory

## Signals

A signal is a small message that notifies a process that an event of some type has occurred in the system

- Akin to exceptions and interrupts
- Sent from the kernel (or process) to a process
- Signal type is identified by small integer ID's (1-30)
- Only information in a signal is its ID and the fact that it arrived

### How to send a signal

Kernel sends (delivers) a signal to a destination process by updating some state in the context of the destination process

A destination process receives a signal when it is forced by the kernel to react in some way to the delivery of the signal

- Ignore the signal
- Terminate the process (with optional core dump)
- Catch the signal by executing a user-level function (signal handler)

### Signal states

- Pending: sent but not yet received
  - There can be at most one pending signal of any particular type
  - Signals are not queued
- Blocked: a process can block the receipt of certain signals
  - Blocked signals can be delivered, but will not be received until the signal is unblocked

### Process Groups

Every process belongs to exactly one process group (a ppid is a pgid)

### The kill function

`kill -9 12535`

```c
void fork12()
{
    pid_t pid[N];
    int i;
    int child_status;

    for (i = 0; i < N; i++)
        if ((pid[i] = fork()) == 0) {
            /* Child: Infinite Loop */
            while(1)
                ;
        }

    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        printf("Killing process %d\n", pid[i]);
        kill(pid[i], SIGINT);
    }

    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        pid_t wpid = wait(&child_status);
        if (WIFEXITED(child_status))
            printf("Child %d terminated with exit status %d\n",
                   wpid, WEXITSTATUS(child_status));
        else
            printf("Child %d terminated abnormally\n", wpid);
    }
}
```

### Signal Handler

`handler_t *signal(int signum, handler_t *handler)`

```c
void sigint_handler(int sig) /* SIGINT handler */
{
    printf("So you think you can stop the bomb with ctrl-c, do you?\n");
    sleep(2);
    printf("Well...");
    fflush(stdout);
    sleep(1);
    printf("OK. :-)\n");
    exit(0);
}

int main()
{
    /* Install the SIGINT handler */
    if (signal(SIGINT, sigint_handler) == SIG_ERR)
        unix_error("signal error");

    /* Wait for the receipt of a signal */
    pause();

    return 0;
}
```

**To Write Safe Handler**

- Keep your handlers as simple as possible
- Call only async-signal-safe functions in your handlers
- Save and restore `errno` on entry and exit
- Protect accesses to shared data structures by temporarily blocking all signals
- Declare global variables as `volatile`
- Declare global flags as `volatile sig_atomic_t`
